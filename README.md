# Telekom phonewords

Repository for storing numeric string to word list converter app for Telekom.

Implement a number to word list converter as a Node backend and React/Angular/... fronted.

The backend should provide a rest endpoint that converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of T9 or Phonewords. For example, given the input 23 the output should be: ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf
